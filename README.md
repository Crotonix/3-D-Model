# 3-D-Model
Main Objective : Develop a 3-D model of Mobius-strip which can then be 3-D printed using a 3-D printer.
Description:
All the models are created with help of OpenGL Utility Toolkit(glew32 and freeglut) along with C++. I have also included mobius.scad(which uses constructive solid geometry(OpenCSG) as the modelling method) and mobius.stl which is required to 3-D print the mobius-strip either through Fused Deposition Modelling(FDM) based printer or any other printer. Model of the mobius strip is developed using OpenSCAD(https://www.openscad.org) and same freeware is used to generate .stl file for the 3-D model. Using OpenSCAD is considered as an option because conversion of the model written using OpenGL is a bit difficult but OpenSCAD provides this functionality.
