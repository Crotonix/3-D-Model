# 3-D-Model
All the models are created with help of OpenGL Utility Toolkit(glew32 and freeglut) along with C++. I have also included mobius.scad(which uses constructive solid geometry(OPENCSG) as the modelling method) and mobius.stl which is required to 3-D print the model either through Fused Deposition Modelling(FDM) based printer or any other printer.
